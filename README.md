0xMirror
========

A python script to create the Mirror of an entire hard disk,independent of the operating system.The script is intended to work for external hard drives and memory sticks as well!! 


Note
====

Enter the root and the corresponding paths according to the operating sytem you are using.(The script runs for os x so its using /Users as root and the paths corresponding to os x.)

After runnung the script the directory structure of the entire hard disk is contained in the folder named mirror,the folder is created on the desktop(acc. to the script) however you can change the path and create it wherever you want it to be.


Remaining Issues
================

All the files are not being created.

Make use of command line arguements so as to make the script more generalized.(independent of the OS)
