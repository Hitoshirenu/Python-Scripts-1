Python-Scripts
==============

Some scripts that i've written in python.

* **agecalulator** - Refer to its own Readme!!

* **OS X Mirror** - Refer to its own Readme!!

* **todo_manager.py** - There are times when you have a lot of things to do but you are unable to decide where to start from..!!
This script will help you to overcome this problem, simply store the list of all the tasks you have to do in a text file(for me it is TODO.txt) and run this script on that file,the output will be a task,generated randomly from the list of tasks stored in that file.
Consequently the the output generated will be removed from the TODO list assuming it will be completed by you.
ENJOY...;)

* **googleSearch.py** - This is another fun script, it provides a command line utility to perform google search. It gives you the top links(search results) of whatever you want to search on google.

* **sort_dwnlds.py** - A useful script that organizes your Downloads directory that is often for most of us is unorganized and is a nuisance.

The script was taken from - https://github.com/akifkhan/Sorting-Hat

With some tweaks of my own to suite my requirements and keeping OS X operating system in mind.

* **pdf_dwnldr.py** - This script scrapes all the pdf links that are there on any web page any downloads the pdf's.

* **location.py** - This is a small script that return the location parameters of any location you want.


ISSUES
======

* Handle duplicate cases in sort_dwnlds.


TODO
====

**sort_dwnlds.py**

* Re Write the code ( Find a better way to handle different extensions).
* Make a GUI using pyQT ( Enabling the user to run the script on any folder he wants to)
