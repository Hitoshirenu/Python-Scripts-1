Python-Scripts
==============

Here are some scripts that I have written in python. Most of these scripts were written by me to understand python and get a feel of the language as a result most of them are small and don't perform a great deal of operation.


### List of Scripts

* [FBWishReplier](#FBWish)
* [OS X Mirror](#mirror)
* [The Sorting Hat](#hat)
* [agecalulator](#calculator)
* [googleSearch.py](#google)
* [location.py](#location)
* [pdf_dwnldr.py](#pdf)
* [pyCountry.py](#country)
* [todo_manager.py](#todo)

## <a name="mirror"></a>OS X Mirror

A python script to create the Mirror of the hard disk for the OS X operating system. The script creates a 0 byte directory structure for the entire hard disk.


## <a name="hat"></a>The Sorting Hat

A python script to sort any directory on your linux system on the basis of its type i.e all your music moves to a sub directory MP3, all your pdf files move to a folder PDF and so on.


## <a name="calculator"></a>agecalulator

These scripts will calculate your age and the number of days you've lived till now!!


## <a name="google"></a>googleSearch.py

This is another fun script, it provides a command line utility to perform google search. It gives you the top links(search results) of whatever you want to search on google.


## <a name="location"></a>location.py

This is a small script that return the location parameters of any location you want.


## <a name="pdf"></a>pdf_dwnldr.py

This script scrapes all the pdf links that are there on any web page any downloads the pdf's.


## <a name="country"></a>pyCountry

Made this script with the objective of learning and gaining knowlegde of the pycountry python module (had to use this module in some other project).


## <a name="todo"></a>todo_manager.py

There are times when you have a lot of things to do but you are unable to decide where to start from..!!
This script will help you to overcome this problem, simply store the list of all the tasks you have to do in a text file(for me it is TODO.txt) and run this script on that file,the output will be a task,generated randomly from the list of tasks stored in that file.
Consequently the the output generated will be removed from the TODO list assuming it will be completed by you.
ENJOY...;)
