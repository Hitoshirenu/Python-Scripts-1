Python-Scripts
==============

Some scripts that i've written in python.

* **agecalulator** - Refer to it own Readme!!

* **OS X Mirror** - Refer to it own Readme!!

* **todo_manager.py** - There are times when you have a lot of things to do but you are unable to decide where to start from..!!
This script will help you to overcome this problem, simply store the list of all the tasks you have to do in a text file(for me it is TODO.txt) and run this script on that file,the output will be a task,generated randomly from the list of tasks stored in that file.
Consequently the the output generated will be removed from the TODO list assuming it will be completed by you.
ENJOY...;)
