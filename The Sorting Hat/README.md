The Sorting Hat
===========

A python script to sort any directory on your linux system on the basis of its type i.e all your music moves to a sub directory MP3, all your pdf files move to a folder PDF and so on.



### Why?

The Downloads folder on my Mac became very disorganized with time, having hundreds of file in no order whatsoever made it very difficult to search for anything.

TODO
====

* Find an elegant way to solve the conflict if the file to be sorted (say README.md ) is already present in the corresponding subdirectory ( MD ).

* Make a **GUI** using **pyQT**.

* Test the script on other linux OS.
